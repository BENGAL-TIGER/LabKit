# About building the application suite I've shown in class:

There are two ways to make this all happen, depending on whether you want to go through Anaconda Navigator or use standalone applications. The only drawback I foresee is that the Anaconda versions are sometimes behind the versions you can get by going straight to the organization that wrote the software. It'd be a minor update (v1.3.5 vs v1.3.9). Anaconda does catch up in a few weeks. 

## Applications

Here are the applications in the portal 

1. Jupyter Lab/Notebook

    Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook are actually same application; it comes pre-installed with Anaconda. You can access Jupyter Noteboook and Juyter Lab through Anaconda Navigator or from the command line (use either of these commands.) 

      ```bash
      jupyter notebook
      jupyter lab
      ```
